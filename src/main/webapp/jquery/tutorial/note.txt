jQuery CDN (Content Delivery Network):

Google CDN:
<head>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
</head>


jQuery Syntax:
Basic syntax is: $(selector).action()

A $ sign to define/access jQuery
A (selector) to "query (or find)" HTML elements
A jQuery action() to be performed on the element(s)


The Document Ready Event:
$(document).ready(function(){

   // jQuery methods go here...

});

It is good practice to wait for the document to be fully loaded and ready before working with it.
This also allows you to have your JavaScript code before the body of your document, in the head section.

remember the example in js/basic? On note.txt,
"7. to make scripts works, you have to put it on the end."

The jQuery team has also created an even shorter method for the document ready event:

$(function(){

   // jQuery methods go here...

});

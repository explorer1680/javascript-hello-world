When you change

1. data type:
String, number, Array, boolean, Object
Basically, anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object, and can be stored in a variable. Keep this in mind as you learn.

2. comment:
/*
...
*/

or
//

3. Operators:
equality: ===
Not: !
does not equal: !==

4. define function:
function myfun(p1,p2){
...
}

5. in html, the javascript must be placed inside <script> ...</script>

6. when variable is declared, it has a value "undefined"

7. to make scripts works, you have to put it on the end.

8. "5" + 2 + 3 and 2 + 3 + "5" has different result.
